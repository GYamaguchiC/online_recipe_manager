# Online Recipe Manager

The Online Recipe Manager is a web-based application that allows users to search, view, and save recipes. With this application, users can create an account, search for recipes based on ingredients, save their favorite recipes, and add their own recipes to the database. The project was built using Python and Flask for the web application, and SQLite for the database.

## Features
- User Authentication: Users can create an account, login, and logout of the application. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
- Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes based on ingredients. The application will search the database and return relevant results based on the user's input.
- Recipe View: Users can view the details of a recipe, including the ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.
- Recipe Save: Users can save their favorite recipes to their account. The application keeps track of the user's saved recipes and displays them on their profile page.
- Recipe Add: Users can add their own recipes to the database. The application validates the input and adds the recipe to the database. The recipe will then be searchable by other users.
